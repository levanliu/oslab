# Key OS Concepts for ATE Developers

## Process/Thread Management
Understanding how the OS handles processes and threads is crucial for optimizing performance and ensuring efficient execution of tasks. This includes knowledge of scheduling algorithms, context switching, and inter-process communication. Efficient process and thread management can help in maximizing CPU utilization and minimizing latency.

## Synchronization & Resource Contention
Proper synchronization mechanisms, such as mutexes and semaphores, are necessary to avoid race conditions and ensure that resources are accessed in a controlled manner. This helps in preventing deadlocks and ensuring data integrity. Understanding these concepts is essential for developing reliable and efficient multi-threaded applications.
