# Learning Resources & Tools

## Books
- "Operating System Concepts" by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter B. Galvin, and Greg Gagne: A comprehensive guide to OS concepts, including process management, memory management, and file systems.
- "Modern Operating Systems" by Andrew S. Tanenbaum: An in-depth exploration of modern OS design and implementation, covering topics such as virtualization, security, and distributed systems.

## Courses
- "Operating Systems and System Programming" on Coursera: A course that covers the fundamentals of OS design and implementation, including process management, memory management, and file systems.
- "Introduction to Operating Systems" on edX: A course that provides an overview of OS concepts, including process scheduling, synchronization, and file systems.

## Tools
- VirtualBox: For creating virtual machines to practice OS concepts. VirtualBox allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single machine, providing a safe environment for experimentation and learning.
- GDB: A debugger for tracking down bugs in your code. GDB allows you to inspect the state of your program, set breakpoints, and step through code to identify and fix issues.
- Valgrind: A tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling. Valgrind helps you identify memory-related issues, such as leaks and buffer overflows, and optimize the performance of your code.
