# Next Steps for the Team

## Hands-on exercises and collaborative projects
To build OS skills, the team should engage in hands-on exercises and collaborative projects. This includes:

- Developing small OS modules or drivers: Start with simple modules or drivers to understand the basics of OS development. Gradually move on to more complex projects as your skills improve.
- Participating in coding challenges focused on OS concepts: Join online coding platforms that offer challenges related to OS concepts, such as process scheduling, memory management, and synchronization.
- Collaborating on open-source OS projects: Contribute to open-source OS projects to gain real-world experience and learn from the community. This will also help you build a portfolio of work that demonstrates your skills.
- Conducting code reviews and sharing knowledge within the team: Regularly review each other's code to identify areas for improvement and share best practices. This collaborative approach will help the team grow together and ensure that everyone is on the same page.
